UI flows provides Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities to Power Automate. You can use UI flows to automate repetitive tasks in Windows and Web applications. UI flows records and plays back user interface actions (clicks, keyboard input, etc.) for applications that don't have easy-to-use or complete APIs available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - A preview feature may have limited availability and restricted functionality. A preview feature is available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

- [Create and test UI flows for Web applications](create-web.md)  

### UI flows or Connectors?

With Power Automate, you can automate both modern applications with APIs, or legacy applications with incomplete or missing APIs. You can even combine legacy apps, modern apps, and manual processes in a single automation.

| **Application type**      | **Feature** | **Benefits**     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Modern apps with APIs| Connectors                 | High reliability incl. with software UI updates |
| Legacy apps (no APIs)          | UI Flow                    | Easy to create. Works if no API is available.   |


You will find your UI flows alongside automated, button, scheduled, and business process flows in the [**My flows** tab](manage.md).

## Next steps

- Learn how to [set up UI flows](setup.md). 
- Learn more about the [different types of flows](..\getting-started.md#types-of-flows) you can use to automate your workflows.
